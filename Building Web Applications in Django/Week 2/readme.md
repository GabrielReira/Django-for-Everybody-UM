This week I learned more about views, built-in Django template tags and filters, Django shortcuts, how to apply Django's model query to retrieve items, and I also applied code of Django Template Language (DLT).

Reference sources:

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/builtins/
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial03/

All the code was used in my [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) environment. This activity starts where last week's activity let off.
