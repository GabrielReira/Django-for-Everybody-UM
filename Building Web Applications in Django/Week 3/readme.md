This week I learned about Django Generic Views and reviewed Python's Object Orientation. In addition, I learned how to use generic views by extending Django classes to make a new view class, explored generic views capability in Django, learned about Convention Over Configuration design paradigm, and also understood the definition of some important terminology such as Class, Attribute, Instance, Constructor, Inheritance, Method etc.
