This week I studied and researched more about Many-To-Many Relationships in data modeling, Django admin UI, and preloading data into a database by using a script.

For this week's assignment I developed a data model from a file of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and then built a script to load data into that model. I first designed the Data Model, then built a Django Batch Script to load data from csv into my database, handled the invalid values from the UNESCO file, and finally ran the Script.
