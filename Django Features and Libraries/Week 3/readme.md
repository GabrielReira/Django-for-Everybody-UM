This week I learned more about HTML forms in Django, the flow to create, update and delete a Django form, the rationale of data validation in Django forms, how model and form work together, and how to use routes that require login.

For this week's assignment, I built a fully working CRUD application to manage automobiles and their makes (brands). I had to make a new app named Autos on my site and set up all stuff by myself.
