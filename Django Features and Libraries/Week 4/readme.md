This week I learned more about SQL and how to design data models. Besides, I learned the importance of following the normal-form and not replicate string data, and I did this by using multiple tables and making link between rows of two tables. I also learned more about one-to-many data modeling, how representing relationsships in Django, Primary Key and Foreign Key, migrations and how they work, and figure out how to write a script to load data into my database after defining the Django models.

For this week's assignment I had to build another application named Cat on my site. It was a web based app to track data about cats, a fully database CRUD starting from scratch.
