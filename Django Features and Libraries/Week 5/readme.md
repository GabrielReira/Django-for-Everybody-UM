This week I worked more with object oriented programming, reviewed the CRUD form flow within a generic editing view, learned about crispy forms, social login with Django, how we can mark rows as "owned" by the users who create them (owning rows in a model), and urderstood how to create and use a Bootstrap menu and put it on a page through an extension.

This week's assignment was really hard and laborious, I had to build a Classified Ad Website. In this app named Ad, people can view ads without logging in and if they log in, they can create their own ads. Besides, it uses a social login that allows logging in using github accounts.
