This week I studied about cookies and how they work in the browser. Furthermore, I explored how to set and read cookies in Django, how cookies are used to support sessions in Django and how to use sessions in Django. Lastly, I created by my own two new applications (Home and Hello) on my site using the concept of DIY (Do It Tourself).
