This week I did the last Milestone of my Classified Ad Web Site and completed the specialization course. For this fourth milestone, I've added two new features to my web site: **search** and **tags**.

For the search functionality I just created a logic to search through querys in database and adapted in my views, and for the tags functionality I used the *django-taggit* library and had to modify the models, forms, views and some other things of my Ad app.
