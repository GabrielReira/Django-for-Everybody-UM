This week I studied about Object Orientated Programming in JavaScript. I learned about the features of the Object-Oriented pattern in JavaScript, its class, instance, method, attribute, understood how to read OO documentation for JavaScript, and built brand new complex objects using it.

In this week's assignment I did the second Milestone of my Classified Ad Web Site. I created some new functionalities: add Pictures and Comments to the Ads Application.
