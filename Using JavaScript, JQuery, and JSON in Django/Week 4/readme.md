In this week I studied about Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). I learned how JSON and AJAX allow web pages to interact with the back-end without sendind entire web pages back and forth to the server, and also how to retrive information from the server using both of them.

For this week's assignment I did the third Milestone of my Classified Ad Web Site. I was suposed to create a favicon and a social login for my website, but I had already done that. So the only change I made was to add support for logged in users to favorite and unfavorite the ads, I had to modify the Ad class in my database and create a new one (Fav), and do a lot of configuration using AJAX to make everything work perfectly.
