Thhis week I studied more about JavaScript, Document Object Model, and learned about jQuery. In addition, I urderstood how the DOM (Document Object Model) can be modified by what you want to do using JavaScript, and how jQuery has made this act of messing with DOM a lot easier.

Furthermore, I studied about Vanilla JavaScript and the way jQuery is useful for selecting and manipulating DOM elements, finding them, selecting them, and how to register events with it.
